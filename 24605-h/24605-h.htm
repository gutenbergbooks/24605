O Thou, who art the source of joy and light,</i>

The great Revealer of the will Divine;</i>

Thyself Divine, all nature owns Thy might,</i>

And bows in homage at a beck of Thine,</i>

Afford me light to guide my unskilled hand,</i>

And by Thy Spirit all my thoughts command.</i>

To Thy great name I dedicate my powers,</i>

Yielding to Thee what Thou with blood hast bought,</i>

Resolved that Thou shalt have my days and hours,</i>

And for Thy sake shall every work be wrought;</i>

And my poor heart with love and gladness fill.</i>

If this strange impulse which I feel within</i>
</p>
<p class="i2">
<i>
To write this book proceeds, O Lord, from Thee,</i>

<p>
<i>
Let it not die, nor be defiled by sin,</i>

<p class="i2">
<i>
But let the work from self and sin be free,</i>

And prove a guide to home and bliss above,</i>

And help to fill this warring world with love.</i>

The Master's touch I know it sadly lacks,</i>

And may not please the nice artistic taste</i>

Of some fine mind that naught but gold attracts;</i>

Some may not count these iron-filings waste;</i>
</p>
<p>

Like magnets, to which gold will not adhere,</i>

<p>

May they find ore in this to bless and cheer.</i>
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>

In this plain pitcher, Lord, Thy blessing pour,</i>

<p class="i2">
<i>
That from it men their raging thirst may slake,</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
And when exhausted is the scanty store,</i>
</p>
<p class="i2">
<i>
Then let the earthen vessel quickly break;</i>
</p>
<p>

Its end is gained if Thou art glorified,</i>

And men have learned to love the Christ who died.</i>

As flowers drink in the solar rays and dew,</i>

So would I to Thy Spirit's touch prove true,</i>

And render that return which seemeth meet;</i>

Come, dews of grace! Great Sun, illume my heart!</i>

Dear Canada, our native land,

<p class="i2">
Our love for thee grows day by day;
</p>
<p>
Our fathers left the olden strand,
</p>
<p class="i2">
O'er sea and rapids made their way,
</p>
<p>
And by their energy and skill
</p>
<p class="i2">
They laid thy firm foundation deep,
</p>
<p>
And sowed the seed o'er vale and hill
</p>
<p class="i2">
Which we, their sons, are called to reap.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The wilderness blooms as the rose;
</p>
<p class="i2">
The old-time hardships are unknown;
</p>
<p>
And wealth in streams of commerce flows
</p>
<p class="i2">
From sea to sea&#8212;a nation grown&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Still youthful, but with thews of steel
</p>
<p class="i2">
To throttle foes that may arise;
</p>
<p>
Yet loving touch sore hearts to heal,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And lift us nearer to the skies.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
We cannot boast as blue a sky
</p>
<p class="i2">
As smiles o'er many an Alpine plain,
</p>
<p>
Nor are our mountain peaks as high
</p>
<p class="i2">
As theirs, yet we have other gain;
</p>
<p>
Our hills are rich in yellow gold,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Our plains are broad and fertile too;
</p>
<p>
Our lakes and streams hold wealth untold,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And grander forests never grew.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Our sky is bright to healthy eyes;
</p>
<p class="i2">
Pure ozone lades the air we breathe;
</p>
<p>
Our climate we have learned to prize;
</p>
<p class="i2">
Nor do we o'er our winters grieve;
</p>
<p>
For nature throws her ermine robe
</p>
<p class="i2">
O'er purple hills and vales as well;
</p>
<p>
No portion of this earthly globe
</p>
<p class="i2">
As gay as this, with sleigh and bell.

And plants long sheltered now are seen,

And April showers and smiling May

Soon clothe the earth in living green.
</p>
<p>
Monotony is thus unknown&#8212;
</p>

Others in various callings find
</p>
<p>
Their missions&#8212;but where'er their place

<p class="i2">
In the great drama of our day,

<p class="i2">
Yet we have no election boss.
</p>
<p>
No union here of Church and State,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Yet Church and State full well agree
</p>
<p>
That nations never can be great

If they refuse to bow the knee.
</p>
</div>

They fought as foes&#8212;gave blow for blow.

<p>
The victors and the conquered now

So give me Canada before

The fairest land beneath the sky.

And all are free, both low and high;

<p>
An infant nation yet, 'tis true,

Sink down on peaty bed.

MY SISTER NELL AND I
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
We strolled down by the river side,
</p>
<p class="i2">
My sister Nell and I,
</p>
<p>
To watch the waters onward glide,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And vessels passing by.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
On Nature's floor of lovely green,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Bedecked with flowers of gold,
</p>
<p>
The purple sassafras as sheen,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Which trumpet vines enfold.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
We played our youthful games for hours,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And told our childish tales;
</p>
<p>
Adorned each brow with fragrant flowers,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And slept 'neath cooling gales.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
For I was then but nine years old,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And she was only seven;
</p>
<p>
Yet joys like ours can ne'er be told&#8212;
</p>
<p class="i2">
They savored much of heaven.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Close by the bank, in shady nooks,
</p>
<p class="i2">
The waxen lilies grew;
</p>
<p>
We called them fish, and with our hooks
</p>
<p class="i2">
To shore full many drew.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
With these I made a wreath for Nell.
</p>
<p class="i2">
She was so good and pure,
</p>
<p>
They seemed to suit her brow so well,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Yet could not long endure
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The heated brow and dewless air&#8212;
</p>
<p class="i2">
The river suits them best;
</p>
<p>
But graced awhile her golden hair,
</p>
<p class="i2">
As dove would silken nest.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Frail like the lilies, too, was Nell.
</p>
<p class="i2">
The fever's scorching blast
</p>
<p>
Swept by, and my fair flowerette fell,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And to the dust was cast.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
But now she blooms in glory land,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Close by the tree of Life;
</p>
<p>
Better to bloom at God's right hand
</p>
<p class="i2">
Than in this world of strife.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I hope some day to meet her there,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And as in days of yore
</p>
<p>
We plucked the lilies, pure and fair,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Up there we'll gather more.

Our lamentations all will end,

Exchanged for smile and song,

HIDE THEIR SCARS!
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A painter, high in worldy fame,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Was sought to reproduce by art
</p>
<p>
A likeness of the man whose name
</p>
<p class="i2">
Sent darts of anguish through the heart
</p>
<p>
Of mighty monarchs in his day;
</p>
<p class="i2">
For he by arms subdued the world.
</p>
<p>
Kingdoms and empires owned his sway
</p>
<p class="i2">
And bowed beneath his flag unfurled.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
But Alexander bore a scar,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Deep marked upon his royal brow;
</p>
<p>
To paint him thus would greatly mar
</p>
<p class="i2">
The monarch's beauty; as a slough
</p>
<p>
Would mar the beauty of a lawn,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Where queenly feet are wont to tread;
</p>
<p>
Or like the cloud at early dawn,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Which hides some glory 'neath its spread.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
To leave it out would not be true,
</p>
<p class="i2">
For Alexander bore the scar;
</p>
<p>
The painter this resolved to do,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Which would be true, yet would not mar:
</p>
<p>
To paint the monarch's head reclined,
</p>
<p class="i2">
With his fore-finger on his brow;
</p>
<p>
And thus much grace with art combined,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Like ornament on vessel's prow.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The finger rested on the scar,
</p>
<p class="i2">
As if mere chance had placed it there;
</p>
<p>
And hid from sight this fruit of war,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And left a likeness true and fair.
</p>
<p>
So let us try, as best we can,
</p>
<p class="i2">
To cover o'er each ugly scar
</p>
<p>
Upon the brow of mortal man,
</p>
<p class="i2">
So none may see it, near nor far.

DUNBAR
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Up to Dunbar our Cromwell went,
</p>
<p>
Not to invade was his intent;
</p>
<p>
But they who first King Charles sold
</p>
<p>
Now turn their backs on friends of old,
</p>
<p>
And principles they then held dear
</p>
<p>
Were sacrificed for self, I fear.
</p>
<p>
Another Stuart they receive,
</p>
<p>
Who knew too well how to deceive;
</p>
<p>
The most perfidious of his race,
</p>
<p>
Corrupt in life, and void of grace,
</p>
<p>
The menial of the Papacy;
</p>
<p>
And yet content by oath to free
</p>
<p>
Himself from Holy See's control,
</p>
<p>
And covenant to save his soul
</p>
<p>
By the Scotch Presbyterian mode,
</p>
<p>
As to the crown this paved the road.
</p>
<p>
But Cromwell brooked not this control;
</p>
<p>
He wished man free to save his soul
</p>
<p>
As conscience may to him dictate,
</p>
<p>
Without subservience to the State.
</p>
<p>
He saw also thro' the disguise
</p>
<p>
Of one well versed in fraud and lies,
</p>
<p>
And saw how England's liberties
</p>
<p>
Were threatened by this scheme of his.
</p>
<p>
So up to Dunbar Cromwell went;
</p>
<p>
To break this compact his intent,
</p>
<p>
Conserve the rights of Britons true
</p>
<p>
To worship God in desk and pew
</p>
<p>
As conscience may to them dictate,
</p>
<p>
Without control of king, or state,
</p>
<p>
Or Papal &#34;bull,&#34; or legate's rod&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Only accountable to God.
</p>
<p>
On Sunday night he reached Dunbar.
</p>
<p>
From darkened sky gleamed not a star;
</p>
<p>
The way he travelled o'er was drear,
</p>
<p>
Made doubly so by Scotchmen's fear.
</p>
<p>
At his approach like sheep they fled,
</p>
<p>
Made frantic by an awful dread
</p>
<p>
Of red-hot irons, spear, and sword,
</p>
<p>
Of breasts thrust thro', and bodies gored,
</p>
<p>
Which they were told would be their lot
</p>
<p>
When Cromwell came. So from each cot
</p>
<p>
They bore away what pleased them best,
</p>
<p>
And to the flames consigned the rest.
</p>
<p>
But now Dunbar is reached; yet he
</p>
<p>
Finds himself in extremity;
</p>
<p>
Midst swamps and bogs unfit to tent,
</p>
<p>
By Lammermoor from hillside rent,
</p>
<p>
Leslie in front defiant stands
</p>
<p>
A noble army he commands
</p>
<p>
Of thousands two score seven, or more,
</p>
<p>
Ready on Cromwell shot to pour.
</p>
<p>
Behind the sea cut off retreat;
</p>
<p>
With such great odds can he compete?
</p>
<p>
The mountain sheep may safely tread
</p>
<p>
The Lammermoor, but men may dread
</p>
<p>
To cross this heath at any time;
</p>
<p>
Much more now, midst the rain and slime,
</p>
<p>
Will Cromwell with the smaller score
</p>
<p>
Dare to cross o'er to Dunbar shore?
</p>
<p>
Tho' shipped were half his guns and men
</p>
<p>
The foe falls ere he turn again.
</p>
<p>
With foresight keen, like one inspired,
</p>
<p>
He saw the end ere Leslie fired.
</p>
<p>
&#34;<span class="sc">The Lord</span>,&#34; said he, as rapt he stands,
</p>
<p>
&#34;<span class="sc">Hath given them into our hands</span>!&#34;
</p>
<p>
'Tis the ninth month and second day,
</p>
<p>
A wild, wet night, historians say.
</p>
<p>
Quit you like men, and bravely stand;
</p>
<p>
Death's wrestle now is close at hand;
</p>
<p>
Heed not the hoarse sea's doleful moan,
</p>
<p>
As on the cliffs its waves are thrown.
</p>
<p>
Think not of life nor kindred dear&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Who goes to war should nothing fear
</p>
<p>
But God, whose eye-lids never sleep&#8212;
</p>
<p>
His Israel He will safely keep.
</p>
<p>
Oh, pray! but keep your powder dry&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Your part do, then on God rely.
</p>
<p>
Stand to your arms the whole night thro'
</p>
<p>
Or lie awake with arms in view.
</p>
<p>
And you, ye Scots, your lights blow out,
</p>
<p>
But stay not in your strong redoubt.
</p>
<p>
'Midst shocks of corn your shelter seek,
</p>
<p>
And rest in sleep; your foe is weak,
</p>
<p>
Yet ere another night comes 'round
</p>
<p>
In deeper slumber shall be found
</p>
<p>
Full many of your stalwart host,
</p>
<p>
And stilled for aye their every boast.
</p>
<p>
In Cromwell's camp all night was heard
</p>
<p>
The voice of prayer in tones which stirred
</p>
<p>
The tender hearts of &#34;Ironside&#34; men,
</p>
<p>
As never can be told by pen.
</p>
<p>
Ere shone the first faint streak of morn,
</p>
<p>
The Scots beneath the shocks of corn,
</p>
<p>
Stretched out full length in quiet sleep,
</p>
<p>
Hear a loud blast, and upward leap
</p>
<p>
To seize their arms and face the foe.
</p>
<p>
Too late the warning! or, too slow
</p>
<p>
Their movements when the trump was heard,
</p>
<p>
Yet rang along the lines the word
</p>
<p>
Of battle-cry by Leslie sent,
</p>
<p>
&#34;<i>The Covenant! The Covenant!</i>&#34;
</p>
<p>
While high and strong was Cromwell's boast,
</p>
<p>
&#34;<i>The Lord of Hosts! The Lord of Hosts!</i>&#34;
</p>
<p>
With master skill he struck the blow,
</p>
<p>
And when shone out the crimson glow
</p>
<p>
Of morning sun upon the sea,
</p>
<p>
Brave Leslie's men began to flee.
</p>
<p>
&#34;<i>They run! Oh, I protest they run!</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
Let God arise! Let God arise!</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
And scattered be His enemies!</i>&#34;
</p>
<p>
Loud Cromwell cried.
<i>
The work was done.</i>
</p>
<p>
Then rose from England's host a cry
</p>
<p>
Which rent the very heavens on high.
</p>
<p>
Now halt they on the battle field
</p>
<p>
And to the Lord their homage yield&#8212;
</p>
<p>
And sing this song with hearts devout:
</p>
<p>
&#34;<i>O praise the Lord, ye nations all!</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
Laud Him all peoples on this ball!</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
His mercy toward us e'er is great;</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
His truth and grace for sinners wait,</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
Let all the people shout!</i>&#34;

MARSTON MOOR

<p>
The armies met on Marston Moor,
</p>
<p>
'Midst lightning's flash and thunder's roar;
</p>
<p>
As murky clouds sweep o'er the sky,
</p>
<p>
God's cannonade with man's will vie.
</p>
<p>
The Royalists in phalanx strong,
</p>
<p>
By fiery Rupert led along,
</p>
<p>
From Bolton's cruel massacre
</p>
<p>
Towards York, in hope to keep it free
</p>
<p>
From the Roundheads at any cost.
</p>
<p>
&#34;If York be lost, my crown is lost&#34;&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Wrote Charles to this trusted chief,
</p>
<p>
And he must bring it prompt relief.
</p>
<p>
The foe's true strength he did not know,
</p>
<p>
But dazzled much by victory's glow
</p>
<p>
He hoped with ease to overthrow
</p>
<p class="i6">
The untrained volunteers;
</p>
<p>
Nor did he for brave Cromwell care,
</p>
<p>
Tho' he had asked &#34;is Cromwell there?&#34;
</p>
<p class="i6">
Would not his grenadiers
</p>
<p>
Scatter those yeomen to their fields,
</p>
<p>
To hold their ploughs instead of shields?
</p>
<p>
Thus confident of great success
</p>
<p>
He asked his chaplain now to bless
</p>
<p>
From God's own word their going out,
</p>
<p>
And seemed to hear the victor's shout,
</p>
<p>
While from the ranks of Roundheads rose
</p>
<p>
Triumphant hymns, ere came the blows.
</p>
<p>
Now Rupert madly dashes out,
</p>
<p>
&#34;<i>God and the King!</i>&#34; his battle shout;
</p>
<p>
Charges the parliamentary ranks
</p>
<p>
In centre, heedless of the flanks,
</p>
<p>
Defeats Lord Fairfax and Leven,
</p>
<p>
Scatters like leaves their untrained men.
</p>
<p>
Remorselessly he hewed them down,
</p>
<p>
And chased their leaders far from town.
</p>
<p>
But Cromwell kept his men restrained
</p>
<p>
Till Rupert thought the victory gained.
</p>
<p>
His eye was all ablaze with fire,
</p>
<p>
And burned his soul with righteous ire;
</p>
<p>
Then sharp and passionate came the cry,
</p>
<p>
&#34;<i>Charge, in the name of the Most High!</i>&#34;
</p>
<p>
His features now most clearly show
</p>
<p>
A strange, enthusiastic glow.
</p>
<p>
With zeal he wraps himself about,
</p>
<p>
And fires men's hearts with glance and shout.
</p>
<p>
&#34;For God and king,&#34; is Rupert's cry.
</p>
<p>
&#34;<i>For truth and peace we dare to die!</i>&#34;
</p>
<p>
Shouts Cromwell, all the lines along,
</p>
<p>
Which holds as with a mighty thong
</p>
<p>
Th' immortal hosts of Puritans,
</p>
<p>
While on them fall the Royal bans.
</p>
<p>
As Roundheads, Rupert them derides;
</p>
<p>
Not Roundheads now, but

Ironsides</i>.
</p>
<p>
The heavens were black, the storm still raged,
</p>
<p>
As tho' with earth a war it waged,
</p>
<p>
But raged a fiercer war just then,
</p>
<p>
Not forces blind, but men with men;
</p>
<p>
For two score thousand men were there;

<p>
And booming cannon rent the air.

THE REAL

<p>
The leaf is faded, and decayed the flower,
</p>
<p>
The birds have ceased to sing in wayside bower,

The babbling brook is silenced by the cold,

<p>
And hill and vale the frost and snow enfold.

Nor sun, nor star, relieves the dismal gloom;

THE BAPTISM OF CLOVIS

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Five hundred years have nearly passed away
</p>
<p class="i2">
Since that glad morn, when o'er fair Bethl'hem's plain
</p>
<p>
A light resplendent as the glow of day,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Shone down from heaven, and holy angels deign
</p>
<p>
To sing the sweetest song e'er heard by mortal ear,
</p>
<p>
Which fills sad hearts with joy and drives away their fear.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Clovis, of the brave Franks, the king, and sheen,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Heard from Aurelian of a maid to wed,
</p>
<p>
Matchless in feature, and of graceful mein&#8212;
</p>
<p class="i2">
&#34;Zenobia, of the Alps,&#34; Aurelian said,
</p>
<p>
&#34;The daughter of Chilperic, the Burgundian king,
</p>
<p>
Clotilda is her name; fair maids her praises sing.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;She dwells among the Alps, in forest glade,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And by the shore of its most famous lake;
</p>
<p>
But fairer than that land is this fair maid;
</p>
<p class="i2">
And brighter than its peaks at morn's awake;
</p>
<p>
A Christian girl is she, whose heart God has renewed,
</p>
<p>
And her fine, comely mind with grace and truth embued.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Then Clovis, by Aurelian, sent a ring
</p>
<p class="i2">
To this fair damsel, whom he hoped to wed;
</p>
<p>
She took the ring; and soon fair songsters sing
</p>
<p class="i2">
The marriage hymn, as he to altar led
</p>
<p>
This lovely Christian maid. They plight their nuptial vows;
</p>
<p>
And the old priest invoked a blessing on their brows.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Then on her head a coronet was placed,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And she sat down by Clovis on his throne;
</p>
<p>
And never was a throne so highly graced,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Nor ever monarch felt less sad and lone;
</p>
<p>
He found in her a bride, and counsellor, as well,
</p>
<p>
And happy are the men who in her palace dwell.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
In tones of eloquence and words of power,
</p>
<p class="i2">
The wond'rous story of the cross she told;
</p>
<p>
Christ's lowly birth, pure life, and of the hour
</p>
<p class="i2">
When He, to bring us to the heavenly fold,
</p>
<p>
Bore on the cross our sins, and opened mercy's door,
</p>
<p>
Then from the dead arose to reign for evermore.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Soon on Tolbiac's bloody field the king
</p>
<p class="i2">
Led on his troops against a mighty foe;
</p>
<p>
A foe too strong; for soon, though no weakling,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Clovis retreats&#8212;his men returned no blow;
</p>
<p>
But fled as timid sheep before a beast of prey;
</p>
<p>
The conquering Alemanni will surely win the day.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;O king! cry on Clotilda's Christ for aid!&#34;
</p>
<p class="i2">
Shouted Aurelian, as the monarch fled;
</p>
<p>
Then, on his helmet, Clovis his hand laid,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And lifting it, these words the monarch said:
</p>
<p>
&#34;My gods have failed to help: O Christ, Clotilda's God,
</p>
<p>
Grant me Thy mighty aid, and I will kiss Thy rod.&#34;

<div class="stanza">
<p>
On the French pennons triumph perches now;
</p>
<p class="i2">
The foe is routed by Clotilda's God;
</p>
<p>
And Clovis wished to have upon his brow
</p>
<p class="i2">
The symbol of her faith; for 'neath the rod
</p>
<p>
Of the eternal King he bows his regal will,
</p>
<p>
And waits, with heart devout, Christ's purpose to fulfil.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
On Rheims now dawns a cloudless Christmas morn;
</p>
<p class="i2">
And flags of silk and satin grace each tower;
</p>
<p>
This is the day Clotilda's Christ was born,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And to His cause a great triumphal hour,
</p>
<p>
For see, on carpet stretched from church to palace door,
</p>
<p>
A grand procession march, of two-score priests or more!
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Remigius had led the way, and then,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Assisted by his priests, on monarch's brow,
</p>
<p>
And on the brows of full six thousand men,
</p>
<p class="i2">
As they before the holy altar bow;

<p>
The water from the font he sprinkled down like rain,

<p>
Thankful that his blest Lord so many hearts should gain.

This lovely lily, so pure and white,

Seems covered o'er with celestial light;

As if it grew on the &#34;Tree of Life,&#34;
</p>
<p>
And not down here, in this world of strife;

Too pure for earth it now seems to be;

My queenly wife, it was meant for thee.

Its wax-like petals with graceful bend,

As it floats around us everywhere;

And the world grows better by its advent,

This lovely lily, so kindly sent.

It rested once on its crystal bed;

<p>
Neither wind, nor wave, occasioned dread;

Admired by all as they passed it by,

Though the contrast oft produced a sigh;

In purer soil than affords this earth

This lovely lily must have had its birth.

Dive down in search, where the root is found;

In vain you look for the purer ground;

The root is fixed in the foulest mud;
</p>
<p>
And from it grows this pure lily bud;
</p>
<p>
While speckled frogs, and the slimy eels,
</p>
<p>
Around its roots find their daily meals.

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
As lilies fair from the foul mud grow,

So oft it is with good men below;

<p>
And the adverse elements endure;
</p>
<p>
And rise, through grace, to a higher sphere,

<p>
Their hearts in heaven, and their root down here.

<div class="stanza">
<p>
Though foul the world where they have their growth,

Unfit the soil, and the climate both,

<p>
His power to keep they all daily prove;

THE TAJ OF AGRA
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The Shah Jehan sat with his much-loved wife,

<p class="i2">
The Empress Mahal, one hot summer day,
</p>
<p>
In a cool arbor far from courtly strife,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Close by the Jumna, winding on its way.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
In silence played they long their game of chess,
</p>
<p class="i2">
But Jehan's eyes rose oft to Mahal's brow,
</p>
<p>
His ardent love he could not well repress,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Nor tried&#8212;she was his own rich jewel now.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
He stayed the game to breathe some words of love
</p>
<p class="i2">
And press her lips with lips that knew no guile,
</p>
<p>
And felt the thrill, and peace like white-winged dove
</p>
<p class="i2">
Flew down, and she repaid with loving smile.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Then said, &#34;What would you do if I should die?&#34;
</p>
<p class="i2">
He paused a moment, some bright thought to woo,
</p>
<p>
And then, in solemn tone, made this reply:
</p>
<p class="i2">
&#34;This thing, by Allah's help, I'll surely do:
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;I'll build upon the spot where we now sit
</p>
<p class="i2">
The grandest tomb a woman ever had;
</p>
<p>
All sombre tints I deem would be unfit;
</p>
<p class="i2">
For never have such tints thy bosom clad.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;Of pure white marble shall its walls be built,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Adorned with gold, and earth's most costly gems;
</p>
<p>
Each minaret shall glow like jewelled hilt,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Sarcophagus surpass kings' diadems.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;Then to the world it shall the truth proclaim
</p>
<p class="i2">
That Moomtaza surpassed all woman kind,

And I esteemed her more than gold or fame:
</p>
<p class="i2">
Thus cycles vast will find our names combined.&#34;

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The summer breeze now sighed among the flowers
</p>
<p class="i2">
As they play on with solemn thoughts; and sweet
</p>
<p>
As running brook passed by the pleasant hours,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And likewise passed the burning summer heat.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And like the fading day, the Empress, too,
</p>
<p class="i2">
For scarce a year had passed ere set her sun,

<p>
But Shah Jehan, to promise ever true,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Thought of the tomb his loving wife had won.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
No common architect would he engage;
</p>
<p class="i2">
From far and near he sought with eager heart.

<p>
At last there came one Issa, gifted sage,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Whose plan pleased the great shah in whole and part.
</p>

On the same spot where they that day had played

The game of chess, and he the promise gave,

</p>
<p class="i2">
On which would rest a palace o'er her grave.

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Then Issa disappeared, but where, none knew;
</p>
<p class="i2">
Cast in the Jumna stream, by foes, some thought.
</p>
<p>
They dragged the stream, nor came the slightest clue,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And on his fate the oracles were dumb.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The years rolled by, yet Jehan rested not,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Tho' hope, so long delayed, engendered gloom,
</p>
<p>
Content to live himself in any cot;
</p>
<p class="i2">
But no inferior hand must touch her tomb.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Seven years had gone, when Issa came again,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And offered this excuse for his delay,

To have it settle I have stayed away.

Then on this base as firm as granite rock,

<p class="i2">
Has moved, tho' built two hundred years ago.

<p>
For ten long years wrought twenty thousand men,

</p>
<p class="i2">
To love so Jacob-like the years seemed few.
</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>
From every part of his domain they brought

But then the grandest tomb in any land.

By Titans built, it seems, as mountain high

In length it is a thousand feet well nigh,

Its width three hundred feet by measure shown.

QUEEN VICTORIA

<p>
We do not sing of vast domain&#8212;

Empires as vast as ours are seen,

We sing the virtues of our Queen.

<p>
We think of her when but a maid

<p class="i2">
The message came, &#34;<i>the King is dead!</i>&#34;

<p class="i2">
In deep distress of mind, she said:
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;<i>In my behalf I ask your prayers.</i>&#34;
</p>
<p class="i2">
Then falling on her knees to pray,
</p>
<p>
She told the Lord her fears and cares,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And sought from Him strength for her day.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
He seemed to say, &#34;<i>Child, do not fear;</i>

I will uphold thee with my hand,</i>

And I will make thy pathway clear,</i>

'Twas thus began Victoria's reign,

Her enemies will plot in vain,

<p class="i2">
For it is destined to endure.

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
But while she sits on regal throne,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And acts full well a regal part,

She reigns not on the throne alone,

<p class="i2">
She reigns to-day in England's heart.

</div>
<div class="stanza">

Her queenly heart with pity throbs

Through sorrows deep her path has led,

By grief secluded from the world,

And as she wept a nation's tears

In heartfelt sympathy were shed;

SILVER TONES
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A stately church by pious hands erected long ago,
</p>
<p>
Was found to lack a vesper bell, by which the poor might know
</p>
<p>
The hour of prayer, the hour of mass, and who had lately died,
</p>
<p>
The hour when gent and bonny lass, so timid at his side,
</p>
<p>
Would stand before the surpliced priest, and twain would pledge their troth,
</p>
<p>
The hour in which the priest would vent on heretic his wrath.
</p>
<p>
The faithful then were called upon to bring from home and mine
</p>
<p>
The metal for the holy bell, which must be strong and fine.
</p>
<p>
In smelting pot of massive size they placed the needed ore;
</p>
<p>
A molten mass it soon became, but ere in mould they pour,
</p>
<p>
And thus provide a bell for God to grace His temple fair,
</p>
<p>
In crowds the people came, to see the metal glowing there.
</p>
<p>
Then as they passed, with hearts devout, each took a silver coin
</p>
<p>
And dropped it in the glowing mass&#8212;no priest did this enjoin.
</p>
<p>
They wished to show their grateful love to Him who bore their sin;
</p>
<p>
A simple form which love took on, not done God's grace to win.
</p>
<p>
Nor did they hope to win applause from priest and saintly friar;
</p>
<p>
If God were pleased they asked no more, nor more did they desire;
</p>
<p>
Nor did they deem their silver lost, though little dreamed they then
</p>
<p>
The grand result of their small gifts, which now is known to men.
</p>
<p>
Their coins were for a moment seen, like flakes of snow on sward,
</p>
<p>
And then they melted out of sight, yet, seen by their blest Lord,
</p>
<p>
They mingled with the glowing mass, and when in high church tower
</p>
<p>
The bell was hung and daily rung, all people felt its power.
</p>
<p>
Its booming tones were soft and sweet, and echoed o'er their hills
</p>
<p>
In a grand symphony of praise, subduing all their wills,
</p>
<p>
And calling forth from old and young a burst of rapturous praise.
</p>
<p>
Their gifts, though small, were not despised; God turned them into lays.
</p>
<p>
This world is one great smelting pot in which life's ore is cast,
</p>
<p>
And from it God will some day bring a bell, destined to last
</p>
<p>
And ring aloud in thunder tones wherever man is found.
</p>
<p>
Oh, may we, by kind words and deeds, give it a silver sound!
</p>
<p>
Each word though short, each deed though small, if for the Master's sake
</p>
<p>
Are said and done, like silver coin, our blessed Lord will take,
</p>
<p>
And skillfully will blend them with the coarser ore of earth,
</p>
<p>
And grander music none have heard e'er since time had its birth.
</p>
<p>
Then from this bell of silver tone will sound o'er hill and vale:
</p>
<p>
&#34;The work men do in Jesus' name is never known to fail.&#34;

Every star that gilds the night

Hangs on it the destiny

Of a world, yea, systems whole,

<p>
Should it from its globe remove,
</p>
<p>
Worlds would clash and chaos prove.

<p>
When we reach the world of mind

Law and order still we find;

In God's purpose is a plan

For the life of every man.

<p>
Free, he may his own course choose,

Help divine through pride refuse,

But disorder will ensue&#8212;

Life a wreck! Yet God is true.

In gentle showers the rain descends,

Compared with which human art looks mean.

The hills are clad in purple and in gold,

The ripened maize is gathered in the shock,

The frost has kissed the nuts, their shells unfold,

And fallen leaves are floating on the lock.

The flowers their many-colored petals drop;

But seed-pods full and ripe they leave behind,

A prophecy of more abundant crop,

<p class="i2">
And proof that nature in decay is kind.

But still the dahlia blooms, and pansies, too;

The golden-rod still rears its yellow crest.

The luscious grape has donned its purple vest.

Blends with its purple-red a brighter shade.

Co-mingled thus our praises they evoke,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Tho' we know well this glory soon must fade.

To reproduce an hundred-fold next year.

The melon yellows in the kindly sun,

The thrush no longer sings its tender song

God with His hands of wind for woof collects

The forest leaves, and weaves them with the grass,

With nap of richest hues the fabric decks,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And spreads it out for feet of every class.

A haze at times may veil the smiling sky,

THE MOSS ROSE
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
'Tis said, long since an angel came to earth,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Sent by his Lord, to help with loving hand
</p>
<p>
A suffering one, afflicted from his birth.
</p>
<p class="i2">
The limb was healed as by divine command,
</p>
<p>
But He felt weak, for strength from Him had gone,
</p>
<p class="i2">
A sacrifice which love could not withhold;
</p>
<p>
So he sought shelter till the morning dawn,
</p>
<p class="i2">
But none received&#8212;they prized not love, but gold.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Then 'neath a rose bush did the angel lie,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And rested well until the break of day,
</p>
<p>
When much refreshed he sought his home on high,
</p>
<p class="i2">
But ere he started on his upward way,
</p>
<p>
He said to sheltering rose, in loving voice,
</p>
<p class="i2">
&#34;What man refused thou hast afforded me.
</p>
<p>
What is thy wish? Make known to me thy choice;
</p>
<p class="i2">
The God of love and power will grant it thee!&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;I ask no brighter hue,&#34; the rose replied,
</p>
<p class="i2">
&#34;Both old and young smile on me as they pass,
</p>
<p>
My buds adorn the bosom of the bride,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And hide among the locks of lovely lass;
</p>
<p>
With fragrance, too, I own myself content,
</p>
<p class="i2">
For naught on earth surpasses me in this;
</p>
<p>
But if, indeed, my Maker thee has sent
</p>
<p class="i2">
I ask but this, to consummate my bliss:
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;I feel the cold, both in my bark and bud,
</p>
<p class="i2">
When Autumn winds sweep o'er the western hill,
</p>
<p>
And frozen dewdrops oft my branches stud,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Which mar my beauty and my juices chill.
</p>
<p>
Give me an extra garb, 'tis all I lack.&#34;
</p>
<p class="i2">
&#34;Thou hast thy wish, I shelter found in thee,
</p>
<p>
I take delight in kind to pay thee back.
</p>
<p class="i2">
Let softest moss thy extra garment be.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Then touched the angel bark, and bud, and leaf,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And soft green moss suffused it o'er and o'er.
</p>
<p>
He lingered near it for a moment brief,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Plucked off a bud, which he to heaven bore;
</p>
<p>
And now the rose smiles at the raging storm,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Defies the wind and nipping frost as well;
</p>
<p>
Its fragrance still retains, and lovely form,
</p>
<p class="i2">
While nestling budlets this old story tell.

GOD'S CARE

<div class="stanza">
<p>
I fear not, my Father, the tempest's loud roar,
</p>
<p>
Nor dread the huge breakers on the rock-girded shore;
</p>
<p>
Thy presence is with me, my refuge is near,
</p>
<p>
With help all-sufficient; oh, why should I fear?
</p>
<p>
Tho' billows of sorrow should roll o'er my head,
</p>
<p>
My sun sink in darkness, and joys be all dead,

<p>
Thy presence will cheer me, and spectres will flee,

My lot on earth is not all mirth,

Nor is it constant gloom;

Some joys decay and fall away,

But leave much lasting bloom.

<p>
My wishes are not always met,

GOD'S FOOT ON THE CRADLE
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The air is chill with the frost of doubt,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And men's hearts are sadly failing;
</p>
<p>
They do not hear the great Victor's shout;
</p>
<p class="i2">
But indulge in bitter wailing.
</p>
<p>
&#34;The old gives place to the new,&#34; they say,
</p>
<p class="i2">
&#34;And fond hopes are daily buried;
</p>
<p>
Our cherished views are oft borne away,

As if by the tempest hurried.

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;The world is stirred to its very heart,

And the Church shares the commotion;

</p>
<p class="i2">
To sail on an unknown ocean.
</p>
<p>
The world now heaves like the great sea's breast,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And rocks like an infant's cradle;
</p>
<p>
And looking up, by sore grief oppressed,
</p>
<p class="i2">
We find the sky draped in sable.&#34;

<p>
I will not fear, though the earth should rock,

Rejoicing that God is able

To still the world with His mighty hand,

<p class="i2">
If His timid child should waken;
</p>
<p>
Or, if it rock, He will by me stand;

And my heart shall not be shaken.

GOD'S GIFTS TO BE ENJOYED

<p>
From God's all bounteous hand descend

Rare gifts in rich effusion,

Enjoyment is a duty.

We do not fit ourselves for bliss

So eat and drink, rejoice and sing,

BAG YOUR GAME
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Two men, well versed in use of arms,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Set out, 'tis said, in search of game.
</p>
<p>
Each felt that hunting had its charms,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Yet widely differed they in aim.
</p>
<p>
Both felt their need of wholesome food
</p>
<p class="i2">
For present use and winter's store;
</p>
<p>
But one was of a careless mood&#8212;
</p>
<p class="i2">
Than the day's sport he asked no more.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
No game he bagged from morn till night,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Content to show his master skill
</p>
<p>
In hitting every bird at sight,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And shooting down the deer at will.
</p>
<p>
Grand sport he deemed it, day by day,
</p>
<p class="i2">
As in the tangled forest brake
</p>
<p>
He brought the bounding stag to bay,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Or shot the wood-duck in the lake.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
As he each night to home returned
</p>
<p class="i2">
He sang the pleasure of the chase;
</p>
<p>
But had not yet the lesson learned
</p>
<p class="i2">
That he was loser in the race.
</p>
<p>
Yet, when sat in the winter's cold
</p>
<p class="i2">
And game had fled to warmer clime,
</p>
<p>
He had no stock to sell for gold,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Nor food: and past his harvest time.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The chase the other prized as well;
</p>
<p class="i2">
But bagged his game as best he could,
</p>
<p>
And thus had lots of pelts to sell&#8212;
</p>
<p class="i2">
For self and wife the choicest food.
</p>
<p>
In the pursuit of game a thrill
</p>
<p class="i2">
Of keenest joy shot through his heart;
</p>
<p>
But joy complete he knew not till
</p>
<p class="i2">
He went his way joy to impart.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
While he with wife and children shared
</p>
<p class="i2">
The roasted duck and venison,
</p>
<p>
He felt he as a king had fared;
</p>
<p class="i2">
And though of earth a denizen,
</p>
<p>
Such food would give both strength and cheer
</p>
<p class="i2">
To meet lifes daily toil aright,
</p>
<p>
And winter months he did not fear,
</p>
<p class="i2">
His larder filled, and prospect bright.

<p>
The search for Truth with pleasure thrills;

Possessed, new joy the spirit fills,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And to retain is highest gain.
</p>
<p>
The pleasure of pursuit is lost

If truth itself is not secured.

'STABLISHED

<div class="stanza">
<p>
The well-built house with walls of brick, or stone,
</p>
<p>
May tremble some if struck by the cyclone;
</p>
<p>
The most established saint may trials feel,
</p>
<p>
As flint may turn the edge of finest steel.
</p>
<p>
Satanic hosts may rush in like a flood,
</p>
<p>
Allied with foes of our own flesh and blood,
</p>
<p>
The elements of earth and hell combine,
</p>
<p>
Yet tho' he trembles, stands in strength divine;
</p>
<p>
He rests secure on the unyielding rock.
</p>
<p>
The top may sway, but base feels not the shock;
</p>
<p>
His heart is fixed, nor earth nor hell can move;
</p>
<p>
They wrench not loose, but his allegiance prove.
</p>
<p>
Christ wept with Mary at her brother's grave;
</p>
<p>
Laid down His life a rebel world to save;
</p>
<p>
Tried, like ourselves, and like us too, infirm,
</p>
<p>
Yet knew no sin in either root or germ;
</p>
<p>
Let us be like Him while we sojourn here,

<p>
Then storms and earthquakes we need never fear.

Misjudges God and gathers only woe,

SHE DEARLY LOVED THE FLOWERS

I saw her first when she was old,

Her form devoid of grace;
</p>
<p>
Her locks that once were yellow gold

<p class="i2">
Were white, and on her face
</p>
<p>
Were furrows deep, which told of pain,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And toil, and worldly fret,

<p>
Which all, alas, had been in vain,

<p class="i2">
But nature claimed the debt.

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Her eyes were gray and lacked in glow,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Her voice some thought was gruff,
</p>
<p>
And when excited was not slow
</p>
<p class="i2">
To use a sharp rebuff;
</p>
<p>
For she in speech was free from art;

Men feared her verbal stroke,

And yet they said, &#34;She has a heart;

<p class="i2">
She never wears a cloak.&#34;

Her creed, perhaps, was heterodox,

If creed she ever had.

She knew far more of pans and crocks,

<p class="i2">
But this was not her fad;

Her light, I fear, did not shine out

In pious talk and airs,

In fact I entertain a doubt

If she oft said her prayers.

In line with highest laws.

She lacked it may be that rare grace

<p>
And see the rising waters, and hear the bitter wail;

<p>
The swollen streams now empty their contents in the lake,
</p>
<p>
The waters rise to kiss the skies and walls of granite shake.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">

Oh, hear that awful booming; the dam has given way!

An avalanche of water God's hand alone can stay!

Or devastated towns and homes will mark its onward track!

Ten thousand corpses at your base their soulless faces show;

<p>
Some hid beneath the debris, some covered o'er with slime,
</p>
<p>
Their spirits fled to meet their God, beyond the shores of time.
</p>
<p>
The aged sire and lassie; the careworn mother, too,
</p>
<p>
With her strong son, whom she had hoped would guard life's journey thro',
</p>

Are lying there together, the old and young alike;

Their plans and purposes cut off, no power to love or strike.

Bow down, ye Alleghenies, and weep o'er thousands slain,

Who yesterday were all intent this present world to gain.

Their active brain is sleeping, their busy hands are still,
</p>
<p>
Bright hopes are blasted in an hour, ambitions cease to thrill;

Their mansions, with their bodies, the flood has borne away&#8212;

And wind and wave obey His will, and rest at His command;

But God prepared another ark to bear their souls on high.

<p>
A loving mother with her babe close sheltered at her side;

One hand has grasped a rafter, the other guards her child;

<p>
Oh, how she pleads with God and man in accents loud and wild!

Men hear but give no answer, no human hand can save;

Her voice, alas, is hushed in death by the relentless wave;

But God has heard her pleading, and now His angel bears

Their deathless souls to dwell with Him, where free from toils and cares,

For he had won a loyal heart, and hand without a stain;

<p>
But he lies 'neath the billows, and she will join him soon.

Hark! hark! she sings in accents sweet, to old familiar tune!

Periton

has mounted his famous large bay steed,
</p>
<p>
And flies, not to the mountains, but at his greatest speed
</p>
<p>
He gallops down the valley, to warn of pending fate,
</p>
<p>
And cries aloud, &#34;Flee for your lives! flee, ere it be too late!
</p>

The Conemaugh dam is broken, destruction comes apace!

Leave all and to the mountains flee; leave all and win the race!&#34;

His horse now shares his spirit, and leaps each swollen stream.

With panting flanks and nostrils wide, and breath like scalding steam,

</p>
<p>
Obedient to his rider's rein, resolved to do or die.

Yet on they pressed, till bullet-pierced they fell&#8212;our honored dead;

But he, I hold, was braver, who ran his race alone,
</p>
<p>
No comrade's cheer to urge him on, no bugle blast was blown,

Nor grand review to follow if he should win the day;

Spur up your steed, brave fellow&#8212;the flood is at his heels!

Too late! the waves now gird him round; the gallant rider reels;

Entombed beneath the debris his warning voice is stilled,

<p>
He still sat in the saddle, and held the guiding rein,

<p>
Yet wind and wave awoke him not, and thunders roared in vain.

His spirit had ascended, death set the hero free,

A reservoir was fashioned, of full three miles in length,
</p>
<p>
An inland lake, kept back by dam of insufficient strength;
</p>
<p>
No mills were driven by it; no water-works supplied;

A few rich men, for selfish sport, claimed all these waters wide.

Ten thousand lives were less to them than fish thus daily caught.

The words we speak on the empty air,

Are never lost, but recorded there;

The process we may not comprehend,

Nor how the words with the air may blend,

Accept the fact, is enough for me.

<p>
By God, ourselves, and the sons of men.
</p>
<p>
As sound e'en now may be multiplied;
</p>
<p>
The faintest moan like the roaring tide;
</p>
<p>
The housefly's tread with its tiny feet
</p>
<p>
Like tramp of horse on the stone-paved street.

IS THERE A BRIGHTER WORLD?

<p>
Beneath the surface of a shallow lake,

Where grasses rank and mammoth rushes grow,
</p>
<p>
And playful fish their bright fins nimbly shake,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Or madly chase each other to and fro,
</p>
<p>
The larva of the dragon-fly submerged,
</p>
<p class="i2">
In family large, had taken their abode,
</p>
<p>
And tho' the waves around them daily surged,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Upon the bending grass they safely rode.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">

Content were they with life as there enjoyed;
</p>
<p class="i2">
To brighter world they never had aspired,

<p>
Had they not felt unfilled an aching void,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And heard a whisper of a life attired
</p>
<p>
In sapphire robes, 'midst gleams of golden light,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Above their present world, so dank and chill,
</p>
<p>
Where all day long they wing their happy flight
</p>
<p class="i2">
From roses sweet to lovely daffodil.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
But some essayed to doubt if it were so.
</p>
<p class="i2">
Who ever had returned to make it known?
</p>
<p>
One volunteered that he would upward go,
</p>
<p class="i2">
To bring report; but he was not full grown,
</p>
<p>
And fainted when he reached the surface air,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And falling, round a reed his form he curled,
</p>
<p>
Then cried, &#34;Delusion! I have been up there.

<p class="i2">
And could not find a trace of brighter world.&#34;

Nor disregard tradition's hopeful tale.

They called a council; but it caused some din,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And all their efforts seemed at first to fail,

<p>
Till one wise head suggested this compact,

<p class="i2">
Expressed, no doubt, in dragon larva lore;

That if that brighter life were actual fact,

And all who rose in golden sunshine soar,

</p>
<p class="i2">
And talk about the tidings which he brings.
</p>
<p>
Now each returns, clad in his bright array;
</p>
<p class="i2">
Skims o'er the grassy lake with gauze-like wings,

<p>
Attracts their notice by his plumage gay,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And they collect to hear the news he brings.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Then, holding fast, he buzzes out his song,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And seeks to woo them to a brighter world.
</p>
<p>
And he succeeds; for see, the larva strong
</p>
<p class="i2">
Climb up the grass, and soon in light enfurled,
</p>
<p>
They wait the growth of wings, then burst their shells,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Shake loose the gauzy folds, and soar away;
</p>
<p>
But soon come back again their joy to tell,
</p>

And help their brothers to a brighter day.

With sight undimmed, and unabated strength;

Mount Libbanus adorned with lordly trees,

Gilead and Achor, with their lowing kine,

Saw the whole land&#8212;its hills and vales and streams,

Its lakes and pools, its vineyards and its groves,

A wealth and glory far beyond his dreams;

Better, it seemed, than all earth's treasure troves.

God then revealed a glimpse of His own face,

I would not cherish a wish or thought

Displeasing, Lord, to Thee;

<p>
Thy will is good, and with wisdom fraught,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And that suffices me.
</p>
<p>
I cannot alter a plan of Thine,

<p class="i2">
And would not if I could;

I acquiesce in the will divine,

At times my vessel drifts near the shore,

And the beacon lights expire,
</p>
<p>
The surf-capped waves swell more and more,

<p class="i2">
And threaten with ruin dire;

But only the surface sea is rough;

<p class="i2">
The ocean's depths are calm,

And a star affords me light enough,

<p class="i2">
The Star of Bethlehem.

<p>
And by its light I discern the sand

And rocks along the coast,

And turn away toward a fairer land,

<p class="i2">
And standing at my post,
</p>
<p>
I guide my bark thro' the tempest wild,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Borne on by wind and tide,
</p>
<p>
Till God receives His weak, erring child,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And shelters near His side.

Also, Thy wise design.&#34;

<p>
I would not alter a plan of thine

If I the power possessed;

<p>
My will is lost in the will divine,

'Tis here I find my rest.

&#34;PAINT ME AS I AM, WARTS AND ALL&#34;&#8212;<i>Cromwell</i>.

<p>
Brave soul, 'twere well if all the same would say,

<p>
And artists aim their patron's wish t'obey.
</p>
<p>
What signifies a wart, or e'en a scar?
</p>

Leave both, skilled hand, and paint us as we are.
</p>
<p>
The crowfeet paint, the wrinkles on the brow,
</p>
<p>
The hollow cheek, the form inclined to bow,
</p>
<p>
The tear-dim'd eye, the hair well streaked with gray,
</p>
<p>
The hardened hand, begrim'd with soot and clay,

And if you use the seer's revealing glass,

<p>
When the French soldier from the field returned,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Begrimed with smoke and blood, he felt content,
</p>
<p>
As from Napoleon he this fact had learned,
</p>
<p class="i2">
That thro' his marshall, medals would be sent,
</p>
<p>
The name of battlefield each one would bear,
</p>
<p>
And, also, in large letters, &#34;<i>I was there</i>.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
In others' triumphs we may well rejoice,
</p>
<p class="i2">
If in their triumphs good to us redounds;

<p>
But in the glory we can have no choice,

<p class="i2">
And our rejoicings are but empty sounds.
</p>
<p>
If you would in the victor's glory share,

Be then prepared to add this, &#34;<i>I was there!</i>&#34;

<div class="stanza">
<p>
The victor's joy belongs to him alone;

He stood his ground 'midst storms of shot and shell;

<p>
Thro' his brave stand the foe has been o'erthrown,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And he alone the victor's tale can tell.
</p>
<p>
He now lies down to die 'neath glory's glare,

<p>
For he can say to others, &#34;<i>I was there!</i>&#34;

<p>
Not in some neutral nook must we remain;

The battle rages, we must share the strife;

The world, once lost, we must for Christ regain,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And each lay hold upon eternal life.
</p>
<p>
Who share His conflicts will His glory share;
</p>
<p>
Then looking down to earth say, &#34;<i>I was there!</i>&#34;

<p>
Those who before the throne are robed in white,

Passed thro' the conflict and the foe o'ercame;

Boldly they stood as champions for the right,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And thus have won thro' grace enduring fame,

<p>
And when the roll is called, each will declare,

TRUE LOVE

<p>
He loves not much who loves not honor more;

If men lack this then love must lack as well;

If this possessed no tongue love's depths can tell;

The heart an ocean filled from shore to shore.

Seeing in him the possibility

Of likeness to the great and Blessed One;

It may be even now in him begun.

I love him much for what I hope to be,

And show my love by yielding him his due;

For sentimental love is ever vain,

It cannot peace, much less heaven's favor gain;

But those who love in deed are blessed and true.

MY OLD SWEETHEART
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
My old sweetheart is away to-day;
</p>
<p class="i2">
I feel as I did of old,
</p>
<p>
In my courting days, when far away
</p>
<p class="i2">
I yearned for her more than gold.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I thought of her handsome, smiling face,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Her noble and cultured brow,
</p>
<p>
Of her gentle ways, and charming grace;
</p>
<p class="i2">
I missed her less then than now.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Through the long years of our wedded life,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Now nearly a full two score,
</p>
<p>
She has proved herself a loving wife,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And a sweetheart evermore.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Our love has grown with the flight of time,
</p>
<p class="i2">
As the mountain stream may grow;
</p>
<p>
Or as a tree in a genial clime
</p>
<p class="i2">
When free from the frost and snow.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The tempest may madly rage without,
</p>
<p class="i2">
We have lasting peace within;
</p>
<p>
And confidence ne'er gives place to doubt,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Nor concord to noisy din.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
She will soon return again to me,
</p>
<p class="i2">
From her visit in the West,
</p>
<p>
And the dear face that I long to see
</p>
<p class="i2">
Will be nestling on my breast.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And I will feel as in olden time,
</p>
<p class="i2">
With a love not dreamed of then;
</p>
<p>
No happier man in any clime
</p>
<p class="i2">
Is known to the sons of men.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And when we part at the silent tomb,
</p>
<p class="i2">
'Twill be but a passing day
</p>
<p>
Before we meet where there is no gloom,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And sweethearts forever stay.

Full forty-six years of wedded life,

Enjoyed with my sweetheart here;

<p>
They were happy years, devoid of strife,

<p class="i2">
And full of Christian cheer;
</p>
<p>
Then her Master called her spirit home,
</p>
<p>
And I am left to walk alone.

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Ere long my journey, too, will end,

And my spirit to God arise;

Perhaps he may my sweetheart send

To escort me to the skies;

And there with our Saviour we shall be,

<p>
Yet sweethearts still through eternity.
